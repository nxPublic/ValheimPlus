# ValheimPlus
A HarmonyX Mod aimed at improving the gameplay quality of Valheim. The mod includes several different main features including modifiers to ingame stats of players, buildings and entities and a sophisticated system to build and place objects with high precision and a system to modify already placed objects with high precision. The general goal is to provide V+ as a base modification for your gameplay to increase quality of life, change difficulty or have a better experience in general. The mod also comes with a version and configuration control system for servers and users, allowing servers to make sure that only people with the same configuration are able to join their servers.

*How it works. All mentioned hotkeys can be modified.*
1. You freeze the item by pressing the configurated key (F1 is default).
2. You can modify the item position and rotation with the following key combinations:
  * Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right = moves the building object in the respective direction.
  * Arrow Up/Down + Control = moves the building object up and down
  * ScrollWheel = rotates the building object on the Y axis.
  * ScrollWheel + Control = rotates the building object on the X axis.
  * ScrollWheel + left Alt = rotates the building object on the Z axis.
  * Numpad plus/minus to either increase or decrease the speeds, press SHIFT in addition to raise/lower by 10 instead of 1
  (Pressing Shift at any moment in time increases the distance/rotation angle by *3)
  3. Build the object with a mouse click.
  
**NOTES:**
* *Building objects build with this system are not excempt from the structure/support system!*

# Installation Instructions
We supply 4 different versions of V+ with every release since version 0.8. You can find detailed instructions on how to install these varients below.

**ATTENTION FOR MULTIPLAYER**: The game and the server both should have this mod installed to prevent all kinds of different issues. If you have the mod installed and then have friends join over steam they should have the mod as well.

## **[Game] Windows (Steam)**

1. Download the [latest package called WindowsClient.zip over this link](https://github.com/nxPublic/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Locate your game folder, go into steam and :
   1. Right click the valheim game in your steam library
   2. "Go to Manage" -> "Browse local files"
   2. Steam should open your game folder for you when clicked
   
**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**


## **[Server] Windows**

We will not explain how you create a dedicated server. This will only explain how you install the mod.
1. Download the [latest package called WindowsServer.zip over this link](https://github.com/nxPublic/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Unpack the downloaded zip file it into your root server folder.

**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**


## **[Server] Unix**

We will not explain how you create a dedicated server. This will only explain how you install the mod.
1. Download the [latest package called UnixServer.zip over this link](https://github.com/nxPublic/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Locate your server folder
3. Unpack all the contents into your root server folder.

*Make sure to execute 'chmod u+x run_bepinex.sh'*

*Make sure to run the run_bepinex.sh*

**Uses libc6-dev**

**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**

# What if the game updates?
Game updates are unlikely to do more than partially break ValheimPlus at worst. In case you encounter any issues, use Steam's verify integrity feature- wait for it to download/update all files.
Then simply unpack the *valheim_Data* folder from the downloaded last available v+ version package into your game folder again.
This should resolve any issues related. If you continue to have issues, contact the help channel in our discord server.

# Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement)
* If you have enforceConfiguration and enforceMod enabled, only people with the same configuration and mod version can join your server and you can only join servers with the same mod and configuration.
* If you have enforceConfiguration and enforceMod disabled, you can join every server including vanilla ones as long as they allow you to. 
*(Meaning they have either no v+ mod installed or enforceMod disabled)*
* If you have enforceConfiguration disabled and enforceMod enabled, you will be able to join every server with v+ installed as long as its the same version.

**This system is working 100% reliable and is issue free.**

**If you encounter problems, you have not properly set up the configuration or your server/client is not running v+**

# Join the Discord
We have several different channel including a showcase channel and alpha testing system, allowing you to always get the newest versions available to test out.
