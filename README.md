# ValheimPlus
A HarmonyX Mod aimed at improving the gameplay quality of Valheim. The mod includes several different main features that allow users to modify the stats of players, buildings and entities. V+ also offers players the ability to build and place objects with very high precision through a sophisticated system, as well as tweaking and modifying already placed objects with equal precision. The goal is to provide V+ as a base modification for Valheim to increase quality of life, tweak the game's difficulty, and in general, improve the player's experience. V+ also comes with a version and configuration control system for servers and users, enabling server owners to ensure that only players with the same configuration are able to join the server.

      * ScrollWheel + LeftAlt to rotate by 1 degree on the Y-axis.
      * ScrollWheel + C to rotate by 1 degree on the X-axis.
      * ScrollWheel + Z to rotate by 1 degree on the Z-axis.
   * Use the copy rotation hotkeys to copy the current rotation or apply the same rotation to the next object that is being built.
   * Build the object by clicking.

### Advanced Building Mode
* **Video demo: https://i.imgur.com/ddQCzPy.mp4**
* How it works (all mentioned hotkeys can be modified):
   * Players can freeze the item by pressing the configured key (F1 by default).
   * Players can modify the item position and rotation with the following key combinations:
      * Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right to move the building object in the respective direction.
      * Arrow Up/Down + Control to move the building object up and down.
      * ScrollWheel to rotate the building object on the Y-axis.

      * Numpad plus/minus to either increase or decrease speed, holding SHIFT to raise/lower by 10 instead of 1 (Pressing Shift at any moment in time increases the distance/rotation angle 3 times)
   * Build the object by clicking.
  
**NOTE:**
* *Objects built with this system are not excempt from the structure/support system. Dungeons and other no-build areas are still restricted.*

### Advanced Editing Mode

[Easy to set up and ready to use ValheimPlus servers can be rented here at ZAP-Hosting.com!](https://zap-hosting.com/valheimplus)

This guide does not cover how to create a dedicated server. These are the steps to install the mod:

1. Download the [latest package called WindowsServer.zip over this link](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file into your root server folder.
3. Open valheim_plus.cfg under BepInEx\config with any text editor and configure the mod to your needs.

**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**

## **Linux**

### DIY Valheim and Valheim+ Dedicated Server Installer:
The Njord installer provided by ZeroBandwidth and team allows for you to easily set up your own Dedicated Valheim Server built on Ubuntu Linux. This menu system gives you the option to play Valheim in vanilla mode or with the all modding power of Valheim+.
* All Njord Menu related questions and support should be directed to his community [Njord Menu Support](https://github.com/Nimdy/Dedicated_Valheim_Server_Script/issues)
* [Njord Menu Github Page](https://github.com/Nimdy/Dedicated_Valheim_Server_Script) 

### **Game[Unix]**

1. Download the [latest package called UnixServer.zip over this link](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Locate your game folder manually or start Steam client and right-click the Valheim game in your Steam library and select Manage -> browse local files for Steam to open your game folder. 
3. Extract the contents of the archive into the game folder.
4. Make sure to run 'chmod u+x start_game_bepinex.sh' to make the start script executable.
5. Right-click the Valheim game in your Steam library.
6. Go to "Properties..." -> "Launch options" and input "./start_game_bepinex.sh %command%".


### **Server[Unix]**

[Easy to set up and ready to use ValheimPlus servers can be rented here at ZAP-Hosting.com !](https://zap-hosting.com/valheimplus)

This guide does not cover how to create a dedicated server. These are the steps to install the mod:

1. Download the [latest package called UnixServer.zip over this link](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file into your root server folder.
3. Make sure to run 'chmod u+x start_server_bepinex.sh' to make the start script executable.
4. Make sure that all uploaded files belong to the owner and group who owns and starts the Valheim server, e.g 'chown -R steam:steam ./valheim/
5. Configure server startup parameters:
    * If you intend to run the script directly, open it and edit the variables at the top (description included in the file).
    * If you want to define the parameters elsewhere, you can pass them to start_server_bepinex.sh as you would to the valheim server executable (description included in the file). This is recommended over the first approach, as updates will overwrite the start script and you would have to configure it again.
    * If you are using [LGSM](https://linuxgsm.com), go inside your instance config file and change executable to "./start_server_bepinex.sh" to load the mod and your server arguments. More on LGSM config files can be found on [their homepage](https://docs.linuxgsm.com/configuration/linuxgsm-config).
6. Make sure to start the server via start_server_bepinex.sh, else the mod will not be loaded.

**Uses libc6-dev**

**Most server hosters do not allow you to upload script files or make your own scripts executable (for very good reasons). You will have to wait until your hoster adapts V+ for his servers.**

**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**


# What if the game updates?
Game updates are unlikely to do more than partially break ValheimPlus at worst. In case you encounter any issues, use Steam's verify integrity feature and wait for it to download/update all files.
Then simply unpack the *valheim_Data* folder from the downloaded last available v+ version package into your game folder again.
This should resolve any issues related. If you continue to have issues, contact the help channel in our discord server.

# Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement)
* If you have enforceMod enabled, only players with the same mod version can join your server and you can only join servers with the same mod version.

**This system is working reliably and is issue-free. Any issues encountered are likely derived from a faulty configuration set up, or the server/client not running v+.**

# Join the Discord
We have several different channels including a showcase channel and alpha testing system, allowing players to always get the newest versions available to test out.

# Configuration File

The Config file name is supposed to be "valheim_plus.cfg" and it needs to be placed in "BepInEx\config".

You can turn off and on every feature of V+ via the config file, by default all settings are turned off.

When hosting a server, the server configuration file overwrites the client's configuration file on connect. 

Only the server configuration file (located in the server files) needs to be set up when hosting a server with V+.

When hosting for other players over steam, every player will need v+ and they will receive the local settings from the host's game folder.
