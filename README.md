# Advanced Building Mode
How it works.
1. You freeze the item by pressing the configurated key (F1 is default).
2. You can modify the item position and rotation with the following key combinations:
* Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right = moves the building object in the respective direction.
* Arrow Up/Down + Control = moves the building object up and down
* ScrollWheel = rotates the building object on the Y axis.
* ScrollWheel + Control = rotates the building object on the X axis.
* ScrollWheel + left Alt = rotates the building object on the Z axis.
* Numpad plus/minus to either increase or decrease the speeds, press SHIFT in addition to raise/lower by 10 instead of 1
(Pressing Shift at any moment in time increases the distance/rotation angle by *3)
3. Build the object with a mouse click.

*Building objects build with this system are not excempt from the structure/support system!*

*They are also not able to be build inside dungeons or placed in restricted areas!*

# Advanced Editing Mode
How it works.
*You cannot be in Build mode (hammer, hoe or terrain tool).*
1. You select the item with the configurated key (Numpad0 is default).
2. You can modify the item position and rotation with the following key combinations:
* Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right = moves the building object in the respective direction.
* Arrow Up/Down + Control = moves the building object up and down
* ScrollWheel = rotates the building object on the Y axis.
* ScrollWheel + Control = rotates the building object on the X axis.
* ScrollWheel + left Alt = rotates the building object on the Z axis.
* resetAdvancedEditingMode HotKey = resets the position and rotation to the inital values.
* Numpad plus/minus to either increase or decrease the speeds, press SHIFT in addition to raise/lower by 10 instead of 1
(Pressing Shift at any moment in time increases the distance/rotation angle by *3)
3. Press the confirmPlacementOfAdvancedEditingMode Hotkey to confirm the changes.

*(3. To Abort the editing mode and reset the object press abortAndExitAdvancedEditingMode HotKey)*

**NOTES:**
*People you are playing with will not be able to see the item being moved until you confirm the placement.* 
*Building objects build with this system are not excempt from the structure/support system!*


# When the game updates
Game updates are unlikely to do more than partially break ValheimPlus. In case you encounter any issues, use Steam's verify integrity feature- wait for it to download/update all files and then simply unpack the *valheim_Data* folder from the downloaded package into your game folder again.
This should resolve any issues related.

# Server
If you want to host a server, you can repeat the usual process of installing the mod just like you would do for your game except that you have to rename the folder *valheim_Data* to *valheim_server_Data* before unpacking/moving the files to the server directory. 
Please be aware that **EVERY** client(user) that connects needs to have the mod installed to have everything working as intended.

# Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement)
* If you have enforceConfiguration and enforceMod enabled, only people with the same configuration and mod version can join your server and you can only join servers with the same mod and configuration.
* If you have enforceConfiguration and enforceMod disabled, you can join every server including vanilla ones as long as they allow you to. 
*(Meaning they have either no v+ mod installed or enforceMod disabled)*
* If you have enforceConfiguration disabled and enforceMod enabled, you will be able to join every server with v+ installed as long as its the same version.
